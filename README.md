# System.CommandLine DependencyInjection

## Description

Sample showing how to combine [System.CommandLine](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api) with dependency injection based on [MEDI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection).

This shows how to get services injected into [Command derived classes](SystemCommandLineDependencyInjection/Commands/CommandBase.cs).

The initialization code in [Program.cs](SystemCommandLineDependencyInjection/Program.cs) is kept as simple as possible.
